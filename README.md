# daohacks
Participation to DAO Hacks Hackathon by AQUA METAVERSE DAO , founded by Aquatic Sports fans for the world!  We are committed to the promotion of plastic recycling &amp; cleanup activities worldwide.   We believe environmental extraction of plastics activities self-organized by individuals, companies, and communities matter the most!    Extraction of plastics have the highest impact on our ecosystems!  We will prove it by providing modern tools and websites to organize and track the results of each effort by using multimedia metadata, Geo-spatial information, big-data analytics, Internet of Things IOT device readings, artificial intelligence AI including machine learning algorithms, and real scientific ecosystem analysis results.   Blockchain technologies are used to ensure the immutability of the data we store and use to provide public information data feeds.


During the Hackathon I only had time to create some NFT Collection and ERC1155 on OpenSea , Implement UNLOCK protocol for Aquametaverse DAO membership, 24 hrs access pass to game sites, control access to Discord channel for NFT owners only, and bring your own NFT access control tests to allow holders of other collections to enter a section of the site.
Plugin in Wordpress was installed and tricky to configure using the GUI , need to understand better how to embedd the Code for more complex page and sections access control to content


May the aqua metaverse be with you
